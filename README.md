This Mod1 final project requires students to create their own ORM with Ruby.  Students are tasked to consume CSV's with data about the Colorado school districts, store it in an effecient way and produce terminal output that responds to certain queries.

This project goes one step further utilizing Ruby's ability to output HTML through ERB to generate a static website to display this data.  This is accomplished without the use of Sinatra, Rails or PostGres.  [You can view the static site on GitHub Pages](http://iamchrissmith.io/headcount/)
